## Lucidity Databases Inception

I used this to transform a DreamJournal db to a Lucidity (old version) db. First I exported the db to csv using sqlite3, and aftwerwards imported it to Lucidity. (The label arrays may not work properly) (switch.js)

Then I used it to transform an old lucidity database to a new one (the app didn't work). (LucidityNewDatabase.java). This program can also be used with any type of dreams (just change the getDreams method appropriately)
